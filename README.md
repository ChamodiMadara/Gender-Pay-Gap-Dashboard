## Introduction

This dashboard was created as part of a data visualization project to analyze the gender pay gap in Australia. It uses publicly available datasets to highlight key trends and differences in pay by gender across states, industries, and education levels. The dashboard provides users with a comprehensive view of how the gender pay gap evolves over time and what factors influence it.

## Features

- **Interactive Charts**: Visualize trends in gender pay gaps by state, age, industry, and study level.
- **Dynamic Map**: Explore pay gap variations across Australian states using geospatial data.
- **Filters**: Adjust parameters such as year, gender, and education level to customize the visualizations.
- **Insights**: Get a summary of key trends and actionable insights.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChamodiMadara/Gender-Pay-Gap-Dashboard.git
   cd Gender-Pay-Gap-Dashboard```
2. Open the R Markdown file:
   - Open the `GenderPayGapDashboard.Rmd` file in RStudio.

3. Install required R packages:
   - Ensure all required libraries are installed by running the code chunks in the `.Rmd` file.  
     Alternatively, manually install the necessary packages with:
     ```R
     install.packages(c("shiny", "shinyalert", "ggplot2", "lubridate", 
                        "dplyr", "plotly", "leaflet", "sf", "tidyr", "reshape2"))
     ```

4. Render or run the dashboard:
   - Click the "Knit" button in RStudio to render the `.Rmd` file into an `.html` file.
   - If the file generates a live Shiny app, run the chunks that launch the dashboard directly in RStudio.

5. View the dashboard:
   - If an `.html` file is generated, open it in your browser.
   - If the dashboard is a Shiny app, it will automatically launch in your browser.
